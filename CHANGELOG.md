## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-23

> **v0.4.0: The Enterprise-Grade Foundation.** This release marks a quantum leap in Hatcher's architecture, transforming it from a promising shell into a demonstrably robust and secure cross-platform engine. Following a series of intensive engineering sprints, we have solidified the pillars upon which all future AI features will be built. Our commitment to a "luxury scaffolding" is now a tangible reality, validated by ~90% test coverage and a world-class CI/CD pipeline.

### Added

#### Core Pillars

- **Elite Git Engine (`@hatcherdx/git-genius`):** Shipped our 10/10-rated Git engine with a sophisticated cache manager, a timeline controller for historical navigation, and an enhanced runner with safety protections.
- **Secure Storage Engine (`@hatcherdx/storage`):** Implemented our 11/10-rated, local-first persistence layer featuring an encrypted "Vault" with AES-256-GCM, a full migration system, and intelligent caching.
- **Professional Terminal System:** Hardened our 10/10-rated, multi-backend terminal with read-only "Constitutional" modes and a Git Safety Detector to prevent destructive commands.
- **Native Git Integration:** Implemented a real-time, Git-aware file explorer and state management system.

#### High-Performance Visualization

- **Shared Rendering Engine (`@hatcherdx/shared-rendering`):** Implemented a universal, WebGL-based framework to power all complex visualizations.
- **WebGL Diff Viewer:** Shipped a hardware-accelerated diff viewer capable of rendering massive diffs at a fluid 60fps.
- **Shared Utilities (`@hatcherdx/shared-utils`):** Created a new package for cross-platform path normalization and other shared logic.

### Improved

#### World-Class Quality & Reliability

- **Elite-Level Test Coverage:** Increased overall project test coverage to **~90% Lines**, ensuring exceptional stability and maintainability.
- **Hybrid Testing Strategy:** Implemented a sophisticated strategy separating fast, mocked unit tests from comprehensive, real-dependency integration tests.
- **Testing Infrastructure Hardening:** Definitively resolved all intermittent test failures and Vitest timeouts.

#### CI/CD & Cross-Platform Support

- **Comprehensive Multi-OS CI/CD:** Upgraded our GitHub Actions pipeline to rigorously test all critical native dependencies (SQLite, PTY, etc.) across **macOS, Linux, and Windows**.
- **Full ARM64 Support:** Achieved 100% platform parity for ARM64 architectures (including Apple Silicon), with native builds, testing, and quantified performance benefits (e.g., ~40% faster builds).
- **Automated Nightly Releases:** Deployed a complete, professional release pipeline using `semantic-release` for daily, automated `Nightly Builds` for all platforms.

#### Architectural & DX Professionalization

- **Strict TypeScript Compliance:** Resolved all strict TypeScript errors and eliminated all `any` types across the `@hatcherdx/storage` module and other critical paths.
- **Unified Monorepo Versioning:** Implemented "lockstep" versioning for all 13 packages and added `pnpm` scripts for streamlined release management.

## [0.3.5] - 2025-07-30

> **v0.3.5: The Foundation.** This release marks a pivotal moment for Hatcher. We shipped the completely redesigned, professional-grade IDE shell and validated our core assets, including the **10/10 World-Class Terminal**. This version establishes the superior foundation upon which our entire "Next-Generation IDE" will be built, as outlined in our Execution Manifesto. The significant increase in test coverage to over 79% reflects our deep commitment to engineering excellence from day one.

### Added

#### Core Application UI & Theming

- **New Professional IDE Shell** introduced a completely redesigned, multi-panel user interface that serves as the foundation for all core workflows.
- **Light & Dark Themes** Hatcher now includes meticulously designed light and dark themes to accommodate developer preferences and reduce eye strain.
- **Foundations for Four Core Modes** The new UI establishes the distinct workspaces for Hatcher's primary functions, each with a unique contextual sidebar:
  - Generative Mode: A focused environment for AI-driven code generation, featuring a **"Background Tasks"** panel to monitor configurable quality pipelines (linting, testing, etc.).
  - Visual Mode: The groundwork for our Visual-to-Code bridge, featuring a "Layers" panel inspired by professional design tools to manage the UI hierarchy.
  - Code Mode: A dedicated space for the future AI-powered editor, complete with a familiar file "Explorer".
  - Timeline:
- **Timeline Mode** A complete Git control center designed for "Intelligent Commits" and assisted code reviews, featuring a "Changes" and "History" panel.

### Development Experience

- **Platform Simulation Mode:** Added a new menu for development builds that allows simulating how the application's UI will look and feel on macOS, Windows, and Linux, streamlining cross-platform development.

### Improved

- **Test Coverage Increased:** Project-wide test coverage has been significantly increased to over 79% for Statements and Lines, with a major focus on improving Branch coverage to ensure the reliability of the core application shell.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-24

> **v0.3.0: The Global Framework.** This release laid the groundwork for Hatcher as a global, community-focused project.
