# What is Hatcher?

Hatcher is an open-source IDE designed for the AI era of software development. It bridges the gap between visual interface design and code generation, providing developers with **controlled amplification** through AI-powered tools.

## The Vision

Traditional development workflows break down when AI enters the picture. While AI can generate impressive code, developers lose the deterministic control they need to ship production-ready applications. Hatcher solves this by acting as a precision control layer between you and powerful AI engines.

## Core Innovation: Visual-to-Code Bridge

Instead of describing what you want in text, simply select it visually:

1. **Point & Click**: Select elements directly in your rendered application
2. **Visual Manipulation**: Drag, resize, or modify styling in real-time
3. **Instant Code**: Watch as precise code modifications appear
4. **Review & Apply**: Approve changes with full visibility into what's being modified

This eliminates the frustrating cycle of:

```
Describe → Generate → Debug → Repeat
```

And replaces it with:

```
Select → Generate → Apply
```

## The Philosophy: Controlled Amplification

We believe the future of development isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying their capabilities while maintaining complete control. Hatcher embodies three core principles:

### 1. Visual Intent Communication

Your visual interactions communicate intent more precisely than any text description could.

### 2. Deterministic Control

Every AI-generated change is reviewable, predictable, and aligned with your project's patterns.

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence

Our Playbooks system ensures AI understands your team's conventions, architecture decisions, and coding standards.

## Designed for High-Performance Teams
