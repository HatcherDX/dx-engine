    title: 'Visual-to-Code Bridge'
    details: 'Point to visual changes instead of describing them. Direct manipulation of your live application translates into precise, safe, and context-aware code changes.'

  - icon: üìö
    title: 'Team Playbooks (Corporate Constitutions)'
    details: 'Replace static context files with a dynamic, centralized system that provides AI with the right architectural rules at the right time.'

  - icon: üîÑ
    title: 'Test Auto-correction'
    details: 'Automated test loops ensure AI changes meet your quality standards. This reinforcement loop allows the AI to self-correct until the code is proven functional.'

## Built for the AI Era

Software development is at an inflection point. While AI can generate 80% of code, developers struggle with the "last mile" of fine-tuning and control.

**Hatcher eliminates this friction**, transforming trial-and-error into fluid, intuitive workflow.

### The Problems We Solve

<div class="problem-grid">
  <div class="problem-item">
    <h4>Stop Describing. Start Pointing.</h4>
    <p>Bridge the gap between your live application and source code. The Visual-to-Code bridge translates your intent into action.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="problem-item">
    <h4>Your AI Forgets. Ours Remembers.</h4>
    <p>Replace static context files with dynamic Team Playbooks that provide the right architectural rules at the right time.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="problem-item">
    <h4>No More Black Boxes. Just Power.</h4>
    <p>Maintain deterministic command over AI with visual diffs, automated testing, and a workflow built for control, not guesswork.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="architect-card">
  <div class="architect-photo">
    <img src="/chriss.jpg" alt="Chriss Mej√≠a">
  </div>
  <div class="architect-bio">
    <h4>Chriss Mej√≠a</h4>
    <h5>Principal AI Systems Architect & Founder</h5>
    <p>
      With over 22 years of experience, Chriss is a veteran systems architect and serial founder. His career has been dedicated to building complex, data-intensive platforms for companies ranging from early-stage YC startups to large-scale enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hatcher is the culmination of years of R&D, born from his foundational work in client-side architectures, decentralized systems, and his deep belief that the future of software lies in amplifying, not replacing, human intuition.
