# Hatcher Project Roadmap

Our vision for Hatcher is to build the definitive "all-in-one" development environment for the AI era. This document describes our planned milestones.

## Next Milestone: v0.1 (The Functional MVP)

The main focus for our first version is to validate the core of the "Controlled Amplification" philosophy.

- [ ] Functional connection with an AI engine (Claude Code CLI).
- [ ] Implementation of the "Visual-to-Code" bridge for CSS adjustments.
- [ ] Integrated `git diff` panel to review AI changes.

## Future (Post-MVP)

Once the core is solid, we will expand Hatcher to become a complete platform.

- [ ] **Test Auto-correction Loop:** Integration with test suites for automatic validation.
- [ ] **"Team Playbooks" System:** The first version of our centralized context system for teams.
- [ ] **Multi-Engine Support:** Ability to switch between different AI engines (Gemini, Grok).
- [ ] **Workflow Marketplace:** The long-term vision for a community ecosystem.
