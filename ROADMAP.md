# Hatcher Go-to-Market Roadmap

This document outlines our strategic priorities to bring Hatcher to market, secure our first key partners, and build a sustainable business. Our development is currently laser-focused on the shortest path to commercial viability.

_For our high-level vision and completed milestones, please see the [**Execution Manifesto in our main README â†’**](README.md#hatcher-manifesto-from-vision-to-execution)_

### ðŸŸ¡ **Current Priority: v0.4.0 "The Generative Core"**

Our single most important objective is to deliver a functional and impressive **Generative Mode**. This milestone is designed to validate our core value proposition with our first anchor customer and secure our initial investment.

- **[In Progress] End-to-End Generative Workflow:**
  - Connect the UI to a powerful cloud-based AI engine (Anthropic's Claude).
  - Implement the core logic for generating new components from a natural language prompt.
  - Ensure the AI output is correctly parsed and displayed in the editor.

- **[To Do] Functional `diff` Panel & Control Interface:**
  - The Timeline Mode must provide a clear, deterministic review process for all AI-generated code. This is non-negotiable and central to our "Controlled Amplification" philosophy.

- **[To Do] Stabilize and Polish:**
  - Aggressively hide or disable all other incomplete modes and features to present a focused, stable, and "magical" experience centered exclusively on the Generative Mode.

### ðŸš€ **Next Milestone: v0.5.0 "Initial Market Launch" (Free Tier)**

Once the Generative Core is validated, our focus shifts immediately to a public launch to drive adoption and gather user feedback.

- **Objective:** Achieve strong initial adoption and identify our first cohort of power users.
- **Key Results:**
  - Launch a free, publicly available version of Hatcher with a polished Generative Mode.
  - Continue expanding free features based on community feedback until a strong adoption signal is achieved.

### ðŸ’° **Future Milestone: v1.0.0 "The Monetization Engine" (Teams Tier)**

Upon achieving strong adoption of the free tier, we will immediately move to monetize by solving the biggest problem for professional teams: governance and context.

- **Objective:** Generate our first revenue and create a sustainable business model.
- **Key Features for Monetization:**
  - **"Team Playbooks" System:** Introduce the first paid feature, allowing teams to create, share, and enforce their "Corporate Constitutions" to govern AI-generated code.
  - **Premium Support & Onboarding:** Provide dedicated support for teams adopting Hatcher in a professional environment.
