# Hatcher Project Roadmap

Our vision for Hatcher is to build the definitive "Constitutional IDE" for the AI era, based on our philosophy of "Controlled Amplification". This document describes our planned milestones.

## v0.3.5: "The Foundation" (Released)

This version establishes the architectural and visual foundation for Hatcher. We've built the stage; now the show begins.

- **Key Achievements:**
  - **New Professional IDE Shell:** A redesigned, multi-panel UI that supports the 4 core working modes.
  - **Light & Dark Themes:** Meticulously designed themes to accommodate developer preferences.
  - **Contextual Panels:** Unique sidebars for each mode (`Generative`, `Visual`, `Code`, `Timeline`).
  - **Robust Infrastructure:** High test coverage (>79%) and an enterprise-grade codebase.

## Next Milestone: v0.4.0 "The Spark of Magic"

The main goal for this version is to deliver the first piece of functionality that demonstrates Hatcher's philosophy in a visually impactful way.

- [ ] **Functional AI Connection:** Implement the connection with an AI engine (e.g., Claude Code CLI) to power workflows.
- [ ] **"Visual-to-Code" Bridge (MVP):** Bring the Visual Mode to life. A user will be able to select an element in a preview and modify its CSS properties using natural language.
- [ ] **Functional `diff` Panel:** The Timeline Mode will display code changes proposed by the AI for review, ensuring deterministic developer control.

## Future (Post-v0.4.0)

Once the magical core is functional, we will expand Hatcher to become a complete platform for developers and teams.

### v0.5.0: "The Intelligent Core"

- [ ] **Functional Generative Mode:** Implement the workflow for generating components and code from scratch.
- [ ] **Auto-Correction Cycle (MVP):** Integrate the first "quality pipeline". Code generated by the AI will automatically pass through a linter and formatter before being presented.

### v0.6.0 and Beyond: "The Platform for Teams"

- [ ] **"Team Playbooks" System (v1):** The first version of our centralized constitution system to govern AI in teams.
- [ ] **"Fleet Commander" Mode:** A high-level workflow for managing `features` and `bugs` in isolated branches.
- [ ] **Multi-Engine Support:** Allow switching between different AI engines (Gemini, Grok, etc.).
- [ ] **Community Ecosystem:** The long-term vision for a marketplace of workflows and "Playbooks".
